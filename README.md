# Science Fiction Canon Challenge

#### List of all the sci-fi books I'm trying to read, 06/2016

#### By Eva Yuma

## Description

I'm following along Epicodus' free learn to program track. For the HTML section they directed us to make a website of our choosing. Since I'm in the middle of attempting to read 5 sci-fi books from each decade between the years of 1950 and now, I decided to make a list of these websites and add book cover pictures as well.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* All you need really is a browser and a text editor to view this webpage
* You may copy and paste the code into a text editor and then save it in a folder
* Then open it in the browser of your choice
* If you would like to view the images then create an folder entitled img within the project folder you've created. Make sure the images keep their original names so that the pathway is correct when you view it in the browser.

## Known Bugs

There aren't any bugs per se but it is an extremely rudimentary website with no styling.

## Support and Contact Details

This is just a fun website but if you'd like to discuss it with me in any way please feel free to contact me at eva.yuma@gmail.com. Feel free to use this code as a template to create your own book list.

## Technologies Used

This webpage only uses HTML (for now) and was created to be a rudimentary list website.
